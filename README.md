# dse-highway-fonts

An effort to create fonts based on the **original FHWA 1945
dimensional drawings** for their _Standard Alphabets for Highway
Signs_.

Only the uppercase letters and digits were specified, so at present
time only those are included.  Additional punctuation may be provided
based on later specifications.

Currently available:

-   Series A, one of the original Standard Alphabets for Highway
    Signs.
    
    **This series was deprecated by the Federal Highway
    Administration.  Do not use Series A for actual highway signs.**
    
    Apparently it is still used in some places in Australia.

-   Series B, in use on street name signs, parking signs, and other
    uses where more text must fit on the sign.
