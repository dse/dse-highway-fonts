# highway-series

An effort to use the dimensional drawings from the 1961 reprint of
Standard Alphabets for Highway Signs to create fonts.

This does not include small letters or punctuation.  Capital letters
and digits only.

**NOTE**: This includes Series A through F.  Yes, **A** through F.
Series A existed once, and I'm bringing it back.  There is nothing you
ca---

DO NOT USE SERIES A FOR HIGHWAY SIGNS.  THE ONLY THING YOU COULD DO
THAT IS ACTUALLY WORSE THAN TO USE SERIES A, IS TO USE SERIES B WITH A
DECREASED HORIZONTAL SCALE, I.E., ARTIFICIALLY NARROWED.  I'VE SEEN
THAT DONE.  IT IS AN ABOMINATION ON MANKIND.  DO NOT DO THAT.  BUT
ALSO, AGAIN, DO NOT USE SERIES A FOR HIGHWAY SIGNS.  PERHAPS YOU COULD
SHORTEN YOUR UNHOLY LONG STREET NAME BECAUSE IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE
SOMETHING STUPID LIKE "NORTHEAST KENTUCKY INDUSTRIAL PARKWAY".  OR USE
A LONGER SIGN BLANK, YOU CHEAPSKATE.  IN LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY, AS YOU
EXIT THE SUMMIT AT FRITZ FARM OUTDOOR SHOPPING MALL, DRIVING
WEST-NORTHWEST TOWARDS AN INTERSECTION WITH NICHOLASVILLE ROAD, ABOUT
THREE-TWENTIETHS OF A MILE NORTH OF MAN O WAR BOULEVARD, IF YOU LOOK
TO YOUR SLIGHT RIGHT, YOU WILL NOTICE ONE OF THE MOST ABSURD EXAMPLES
OF THIS ON A STREET NAME SIGN FOR NICHOLASVILLE ROAD THAT INCLUDES A
U.S. HIGHWAY 27 SHIELD.  THIS WAS PROBABLY PUT UP BY A PRIVATE
BUSINESS.

# Miscellany

The longest street name in the United States of America is Jean
Baptiste Point DuSable Lake Shore Drive, in Chicago, IL.  DuSable was
a Black American trader widely regarded as the founder of Chicago.
Street signage usually just shows "DuSable Lake Shore Drive".

In Greenup, Kentucky, you'll find the Northeast Kentucky Industrial
Parkway, which takes second place.  Signage usually simply shows
"Industrial Parkway".
