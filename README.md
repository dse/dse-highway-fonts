# dse-highway-fonts

An effort to create fonts based on the **original FHWA 1945
dimensional drawings** for their _Standard Alphabets for Highway
Signs_.  Later versions of these Highway Gothic fonts were tweaked to
clean up some of the quirks.

Only the uppercase letters and digits were specified, so at present
time only those are included.  Additional punctuation may be provided
based on later sources.

Kerning pairs are based on the 1966 edition, which provided character
spacing tables.

Currently available:

-   Series A, an ultra-compressed variant that is no longer in use in
    the United States, but was one of the original variants from 1945.
    
    **Series A was deprecated by the Federal Highway Administration.
    Do not use Series A for actual highway signs.**
    
    Apparently it is still used in some places in Australia.

-   Series B, in use on street name signs, parking signs, and other
    uses where more text must fit on the sign.
