These are _Standard Alphabets for Highway Signs_, painstakingly
constructed from the original 1945 dimensional drawings.

Later versions of the alphabets adulterated the original fonts by
"cleaning up" some of the curves.  These are not modified in that
manner.

You only get the uppercase letters and digits, since only those were
provided in the original drawings.  Some additional punctuation may be
added later.

Kerning pairs are based on the 1966 edition of the document, which
provided character spacing tables (and omitted the dimensional
drawings in favor of 2-inch-high exact lettforms).

Currently available:

-   Series A, an ultra-compressed variant that is no longer in use in
    the United States, but was one of the original variants from 1945.
    
    **Series A was deprecated by the Federal Highway Administration in
    the 1960s.  Do not use Series A for actual highway signs.**
    
    Apparently it is still used in some places in Australia.

-   Series B, in use on street name signs, parking signs, and other
    uses where more text must fit on the sign.

# More Stuff

-   [Fog City Gothic][fogcity], the good old San Francisco street name
    sign font, based on the original US road sign font.

    Along with the United States Highway System of 1926 came the 1927
    _Manual and Specifications for the Manufacture, Display, and
    Erection of U. S. Standard Road Markers and Signs_, which included
    Highway Gothic's predecessor, the original standarized road sign
    font---a blocky, poorly legible affair.

-   [The 1952 edition][1952], to this copy of which is also included
    some modified character spacing tables of uncertain origin.
