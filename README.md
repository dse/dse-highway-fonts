# dse-highway-fonts

An effort to use the dimensional drawings from the 1961 reprint of
Standard Alphabets for Highway Signs to create certain fonts.

Currently we offer:

-   Series A, one of the original Standard Alphabets for Highway
    Signs.  **This series was deprecated by the Federal Highway
    Administration.  Do not use Series A for actual highway signs.**
